  <h2>What is PunBB?</h2>

  <p>In short, PunBB is a fast and lightweight PHP powered
  discussion board. It is released under the <a href=
  "include/gpl.txt">GNU Public License</a>. Its primary goal is to
  be a faster, smaller and less graphic alternative to otherwise
  excellent discussion boards such as <a href=
  "http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a>, <a href=
  "http://www.invisionboard.com/">Invision Power Board</a> or
  <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vBulletin</a>. PunBB has
  fewer features than many other discussion boards, but is
  generally faster and outputs smaller pages.</p>

  <h2>Where is PunBB being used?</h2>

  <p>There is no definitive list of all the websites that are
  currently using PunBB, but there is a list of the largest PunBB
  boards on the web. It's called <a href=
  "http://punbbig.shacknet.nu/">PunBBig</a>.</p>

  <h2>When was PunBB introduced?</h2>

  <p>PunBB 1.0 reached what was considered a stable state on
  <a href=
  "http://forums.punbb.org/viewtopic.php?id=5407">
  2003-08-07</a>.</p>

  <h2>Why PunBB?</h2>

  <p>The idea of PunBB was first born when I wanted to install a
  discussion board on a website I was tinkering with. After an
  exhaustive search, all the boards I found were either
  over-featured or too graphic for my needs. I wanted a package
  that</p>

  <ul>
    <li>was fast.</li>

    <li>had a simple layout and design.</li>

    <li>was easy to administrate and moderate.</li>

    <li>didn't output huge, non-valid, HTML pages.</li>

    <li>had source code you could read and understand.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I looked and I looked, but it was nowhere to be found. Thus, I
  started working on PunBB, or just Pun as it was called back
  then.</p>

  <p>Developing software to "please the masses" isn't difficult.
  Just cram in every possible feature you can think of and most
  people will love it. Some people, however, will hate it and look
  for alternatives. The problem with developing for that other
  group of people is having to make decisions on whether to
  implement a feature or not. What is a "must-have" and what is
  not?</p>

  <p>Some features that have so far not been implemented are:
  private messaging, file attachments in posts, polls, linking to
  off-site avatars, advanced text formatting controls, subforums
  etc etc. Some of these features might still get implemented, just
  not in the near future.</p>
